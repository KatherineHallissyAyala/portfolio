# Projects
I have created the following projects in a full-stack developer course.

## PacMen
In this PacMEN project, the user can create many Pacman instances and start them moving in random directions and at random velocities. When they reach a border of the screen, they change direction, effectively bouncing off the walls. This project uses Javascript to manipulate the DOM's HTML divs.

## Eyes
This project uses html, javascript, and css to create a pair of eyes that follow the mouse's movements. The javascript code updates the eyes' positions every time it captures movement from the mouse.

## Bus Tracker
This project displays a map of Boston and shows animated real-time markers representing MBTA buses currently running. The map pulls from MBTA data. The bus icons are labeled to indicate bus seating capacity, and you can't miss them because they bounce. Exploring the Google Maps API for this project was really interesting.  Note that to run the Bus Tracker, you'll need your own Google Maps API Key.
